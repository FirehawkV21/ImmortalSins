### Installation

#### Install standalone version

1. Download the game from an official mirror.
2. Once it's downloaded, run the ImmortalSinsSE_Setup.exe
3. If you want, you can pick where the game will be installed, by clicking “Browse…”. Click on Next.
4. You'll be taken to a checklist. If all are ticked, click on Next. If not, click on each item and see what you need to fix them.
5. Wait for a few minutes. Once it finishes, Click Finish. You might need to restart the system if the .NET Framework was installed.

 **Note:** For the most part, having it on the Program Files is recommended, as it makes sure that no other users on the same computer don't tamper with the game. If there's a reason to move it somewhere else (for example, you have an SSD and want to save games on your Hard Drive) then click on Browse and pick the folder on the hard drive.

 **Caution!** Do **not**, under any circumstances, install the game on a Removable Device (such as a USB drive) with the standalone installer. This will break the patching system (and leave some mess on your system, as a registry key and install information is stored on your computer, not on the folder you pick). Use the client version instead. (More on that below)
